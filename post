Hi I am using both these resources, [USDA Nutrition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/) and the [FDA's Reccomended Daily Values](https://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/labelingnutrition/ucm064928.htm),  together. I am having some trouble combining some of the information, presumably due to my ignorance of nutritional science, that hopefully someone can clear up.

1) Iodine, Biotin, Chromium, Molybdenum and Chloride are all missing from USDA database, why would this be?

2) Vitamin E is measured in IU on the FDA website but mg on the USDA database. Is there a way to convert easily? I tried wolfram alpha but it said they can't be converted.

3) There are two entries for Vitamin D on USDA database, Vitamin D measured in IU which I presume corresponds to the FDA one. What is Vitamin D (D2+D3) and why is there no RDA for it?

3) The FDA values are for 2000 kcal a day, is it fair to divide them by 2000 and multiply by the amount of calories I eat to get more correct numbers. I assume their would be some subtleties I am missing doing this but is it a fair estimate? What nutrients would this not be a good estimate for?

4) If I search on the website for a food I get list like [this](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6?fgcd=&manu=&lfacet=&format=&count=&max=50&offset=&sort=default&order=asc&qlookup=cheese&ds=Standard+Reference&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=) which lists the 'proximates', 'vitamins', 'minerals' 'lipids' and other. This equates to about 30 properties. If I pull the fulldatabase each food has a possible 160 properties
